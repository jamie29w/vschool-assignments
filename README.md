Everyone starts somewhere. This is my first repo, in all of its naked glory. Terrible syntax abounds, but at least the console showed 'Hello world'. Then it started to show more useful things. Eventually I built some cutesy pages where console.logs meant fixes were needed. And now I've moved onto fullstack apps. But I can't bring myself to delete this repo. I'm a bit sentimental, but mostly it proves I didn't waste 3 months of my life. Enjoy :)
